        <h1>About the conference</h1>
        <p><b>The Kumquat Student Conference</b> is an annual virtual meeting that brings together students, educators
            and scientific
            community.</p>
        <p>The conference will take place <b>online on 16-20 September 2021</b>.</p>
        <p>Kumquat is <b>free</b> of any fees.</p>
        <p><b>Before asking any questions, please check if they aren't already answered in our <a

        <p>Kumquat is a conference that is created by students for students. The main driving force behind its creation
            are
            the activities of members of scientific clubs and students who are associated with research groups at our
            university.
            We want to create an event where we will be able to present our research results, show what we do, but also
            listen
            to what our colleagues all around the world are doing, exchange scientific experience, and meet interesting
            people. </p>

      <h1>Organizers</h1>
      <p><b><a href = "http://www.nabla.pwr.edu.pl/">Physics Student Society Nabla</a></b> brings together students interested in theoretical physics, but also Complex Systems,
        Machine Learning, Neural Networks and other tools of pure and applied mathematics in physics. In theoretical physics statistical
        mechanics and condensed matter are dominant.</p>
        <p><b><a href = "http://qubit.pwr.edu.pl/">Qubit</a></b> deals with the broadly defined Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory. Members of the club
        are involved in many projects related to these fields, both from the theoretical side and broadly understood applications.</p>

        <h1>Reasons</h1>
        <p>At the <b><a href="http://pwr.edu.pl/en/" target="_blank">Wrocław University of Science and
                    Technology</a></b> groups that deal with theoretical physics are very active.
            It is impossible to list them all, but they are concentrated in Department of Theoretical Physics and
            Department of
            Quantum Technologies.</p>
        <p>As for the Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory, at the Wrocław University of Science and
            Technology
            there is a <b><a href="http://www.nlqt.wppt.pwr.edu.pl/" target="_blank">National Quantum Technology
                    Laboratory</a></b> where various applications of Quntum Computing and Quantum
            Information Theory are developed, mainly quantum cryptography, which is quite innovative on a national and
            global
            scale.There is also <b><a href="http://www.if.pwr.edu.pl/~katarzynaroszak/index.html" target="_blank">Quantum
                    Correlations in Solid-state Qubits Research Group</a></b>.</p>
        <p>In the subject of Complex Systems we are really proud of <b><a
                        href="http://www.if.pwr.wroc.pl/~katarzynaweron/SPICY.html" target="_blank">Statistical Physics
