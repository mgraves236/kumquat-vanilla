        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <div class="question"> What is the cost of attending the conference?</div>
        The conference is entirely free of charge.

        <div class="question">Where will the conference be held?</div>
            The event is fully online and will be hosted using Zoom. The speakers will be provided with meeting links
            via the contact emails provided at registration. Presentations and guest lectures will be streamed on
            YouTube and Twitch as well.

        <div class="question"> Can I speak at the conference?</div>
            Yes, but it requires registration. Applications and abstracts are accepted until August 29. The
            registration form and abstract template are available on our website.

        <div class="question">How much time do I have for my presentation?</div>
            Your presentation alone should last a maximum of 12 minutes. This leaves 3 minutes for questions.

        <div class="question">When will I receive confirmation that I am registered?</div>
            We kindly ask for your patience. Confirmations will be sent to participants with a slight delay.

        <div class="question">Does registration guarantee a place at the conference?</div>
            Your participation will be decided no later than September 1. Due to the fact that this is the first
            edition of the event, it is difficult to estimate the exact interest, which implies that some modifications
            may be needed. We thank you in advance for your understanding.
        </div>
        <div class="question">Do I need to register if I choose not to prepare a presentation or poster?</div>
        No, only the speakers are required to register.
